XPLATE can be used in various industries that use pressurized gaseous reaction including oxygen combustion in boilers, thermal power plants, cement, kilns, steel plants etc.
When pressurized gases, air move in pipe or ducts, the gas molecules collide with one another and pipe, pump, impeller. This friction leads to transfer of charges between molecules, electrically polarize it to generate electrostatic potential & alter intermolecular forces. It causes molecules to adhere together in ""Cluster form"" and prevent such molecules to take part in reactions, causing inefficiency.
XPLATE device neutralize the electrostatic charge and separate these molecules for complete reaction.
